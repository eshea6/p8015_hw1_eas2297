## Problem 1

Here are two chunks of code that create the described data frame:

``` r
set.seed(123)
x = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)
```

``` r
hw1_prob1_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = x,
  vec_logical = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE),
  vec_char = c("You", "miss", "one-hundred", "percent", "of", "the", "shots", "you", "don't", "take"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("yes", "no", "no", "yes", "no", "yes", "yes", "no", "no", "yes"))
)
```

Next is a code chunk that tries to take the mean of the variables in the
dataframe:

``` r
mean(x)
```

    ## [1] 2.891238

``` r
mean(FALSE)
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
mean(TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 1

``` r
mean("You")
```

    ## Warning in mean.default("You"): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean("miss")
```

    ## Warning in mean.default("miss"): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean("yes")
```

    ## Warning in mean.default("yes"): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean("no")
```

    ## Warning in mean.default("no"): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Taking the mean of **numeric** and **logical** variables *works*, while
taking the mean of character and factor variable does not. This is
because numeric and logical variables have a number assigned to them (in
the case of FALSE and TRUE this is 0 and 1 respectively), while
character and factor variables do not have assigned number values to
summarize in a statistic like the mean.

But we can try to convert variables from one type to another, as in the
below code chunk:

``` r
as.numeric(FALSE)
as.numeric(TRUE)
as.numeric("You")
as.numeric("miss")
as.numeric("yes")
as.numeric("no")
```
